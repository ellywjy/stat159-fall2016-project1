## Author: Elly Wang

Reproduciblitiy is very important in today's scientific world. To ensure that one's work is correct and reproducible, many computer softwares are developed to assist with the checking process. In this report, we will document the production of this report itself and note the various technologies that we have used in making this reporducible work. 


#### Introduction

The motivation behind this project is to see how reproducible work could be made with the help of Git, GitHub, pandoc, and Markdown. The details regarding the roles the softwares have in this project will be discussed in the next section of this paper. Overall, this paper should present you how reproducible work is made possible and simple with these four particular technology, and that reproducible work is not hard to produce once you set everything up correctly.



### Discussion

As mentioned above, this report is produced with the help of Git, GitHub, pandoc, and Markdown. In this section, we will discussion the roles they played in helping to make reproducible work possible.
