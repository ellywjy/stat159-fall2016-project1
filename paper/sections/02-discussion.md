### Discussion

As mentioned above, this report is produced with the help of Git, GitHub, pandoc, and Markdown. In this section, we will discussion the roles they played in helping to make reproducible work possible.

#### Git

The first, and very important, software I used in this project is **Git**. Git is a version control program that helps to keep track of all the changes I've made in each of the files in the project directory. Since Git keeps track of all the commits in a log, I can easily go back to a previous version of my work if some of my recent edits did not work. Git is important in reproducible workflow because one can easily check the log and find out detailed steps of what changes were made to the entire project, given that the person who produced the work committed frequently. 
#### GitHub

Git, as explained above, keeps track of all the changes that were made to the project as the author commits his/her changes. **GitHub** utilized the verson control from Git and created a space where we can add collaborators, work together, and share code through the web. Github offers an amazing place for collaboration, and this brings out the importance of Git's commits and logs-- changes made by each collaborator will be placed in the log, so all other collaborators can check what changes were made since they last checked the project. Although Github's features were not fully utilized in this project (since this was an individual project), it did allow us to share our project directories and work space with the instructors, which is an easier way for the project to be graded. 

#### pandoc

**Pandoc** helps with the conversion of documents from one version to another. It's often very useful for us since we may write our code and projects in markdown, and markdown isn't very aesthetically pleasing for presentation purposes. This is where pandoc proves its usefulness. Specifically in this project, we used pandoc to convert our project from markdown files to html so it's easy for the eye to read.


#### Makefile


#### Markdown

Lastly, and most importantly, we have **markdown**. Markdown plays the largest role in this project since all the contents for this project are written in Markdown.  

Markdown is text formatting language where we can write up content, add pictures, add links, and format everything with very simple syntax.
