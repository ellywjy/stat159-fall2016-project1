#### Git

The first, and very important, software I used in this project is Git. Git is a version control program that helps to keep track of all the changes I've made in each of the files in the project directory. Since Git keeps track of all the commits in a log, I can easily go back to a previous version of my work if some of my recent edits did not work. Git is important in reproducible workflow because one can easily check the log and find out detailed steps of what changes were made to the entire project, given that the person committed frequently, and where the error occured if there is an error.
