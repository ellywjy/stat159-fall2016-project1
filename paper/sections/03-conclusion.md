### Conclusion

As mentioned above, we used all five software packages (Makefile, Git, Github, pandoc, and Markdown) in this project. All these packages were essential in making this project a reproducible one. Given the directory with the section files, all one has to do is to run the Makefile to generate the final paper.

The easy parts of the project was writing up the content and putting them together with command lines tools. With the Makefile set up correctly, the easiest part of this project is probably weaving the paper together and creating the final html. The challenging part and the most time-consuming of this project is probably the setup. Getting the directories and creating the Makefile. Once the directory and Makefile were in place, the rest of the project is very straight forward. This project took around 3 hours to complete, but with more familiarity with the packages used in this project, another project that is similar to this one will probably take shorter time. 

In conclusion, this project uses the five important software -- Makefile, Git, Github, pandoc, and markdown -- to show how fast and simple it is to create reproducible work. With more technology developing, we, as students learning data science and possibly future researchers, should not be afraid of wasting time on making work reproducible. Reproducible work may be a bit time-consuming in the beginning, its repeatable nature makes checking work and further researches possible and easier.
